<h1 class="title">{% trans "NEUMA, a music score digital library" %}</h1>

<div class="story">{% blocktrans %} NEUMA is a digital library
	that aims at publishing on-line rare corpora of music. We maintain and
	develop collections of scores with a clear and flexible organization
	based on interrelated corpus, so that users can easily browse, search
	and access them. NEUMA is also an open platform: as a user, you can get
	an account, create your own corpora and enrich them with new scores,
	annotate existing scores, and, overall, contribute to the collaborative
	effort of publishing beautiful but hardly accessible music works.

	contribute to NEUMA: select and annotate existing scores, join a
	contributor team, or create and manage your own corpus/corpora. Please
	sign in and contact the corpora administrator.
