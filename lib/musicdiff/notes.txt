The code is taken fromthe musicdiff package, with slight changes

Files are mostly unchanged. I commented some 
    parts that I do not want to execute, especially
      - lyrics management  in comparison.py (line 922)
      - beaming (line 885, same file)
      
      
Some tests have been added to prevent errors:

  Line 961 of visualization.py, Rest do not have pitch, so 
  we must check the following part
   
                   if hasattr(note2, "pitch"):
                    if note2.pitch.accidental:
                        note2.pitch.accidental.style.color = Visualization.DELETED_COLOR
